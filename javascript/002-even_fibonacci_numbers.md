# Even Fibonacci numbers

## Problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

8 = 3 + 5
8 = 3 + (2 + 3)

## Solution 2

We'll count out sequence as:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`
`0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11, ...`

It's clear to see that (3n)th number is even. We'll use this fact to count the sum as we build the sequence without having to do `%` operation every time

We do have to keep in mind that if the last element that we added (ie the first element after our max) is even, then we have to remove that from the sum. Ie. we don't want to accidentally add a number greater than the max just cuz of the way for loops work
